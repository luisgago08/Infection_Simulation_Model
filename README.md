# Infection_Simulation_Model
This project focuses on designing and modeling the movement of people within healthcare environments to simulate and predict infection dynamics. Utilizing a modified
Susceptible-Infected model, the study aims to develop a comprehensive simulation that
considers spatial layout, crowd behavior, and disease transmission dynamics. The objectives include optimizing facility design, assessing the role of people movements in the
transmission dynamics of diseases, and implementing effective infection control measures.
